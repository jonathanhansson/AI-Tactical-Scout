    SCOUTING REPORT FOR Ethan Walker
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Subject: Scout Report – Ethan Walker (Crystal Palace)

This report details my unbridled enthusiasm for Ethan Walker, a 23-year-old English central midfielder currently at Crystal Palace, who I firmly believe represents a generational talent on the cusp of truly exploding onto the global stage. What immediately strikes you about Walker is his profound footballing intelligence and the elegance with which he executes even the most complex actions. He isn't just a player; he's an artist on the pitch, someone who sees the game several steps ahead of his peers, making him an absolute orchestrator in the engine room.

Walker's playstyle is defined by his exceptional ability to dictate the tempo and unlock even the most resolute defences. His **passing** is simply exquisite, a testament to hours of refined technique and an innate understanding of space. Whether it's a laser-guided through ball to split a defensive line, a perfectly weighted cross-field switch to change the point of attack, or a clever flick in tight spaces, his distribution is consistently incisive and inventive. This marries perfectly with his extraordinary **vision**. He possesses that rare gift of being able to spot runs and passing lanes that simply don't exist for most players, often catching opponents flat-footed with his audacious yet accurate delivery. He is the heartbeat of his team, constantly demanding the ball, turning, and looking to play forward, always seeking to create danger and put his teammates into goal-scoring positions.

Beyond his creative prowess, Walker offers a genuine goal threat from distance, a trait that adds another potent dimension to his overall game. His **long shots** are a weapon in themselves, struck with power, accuracy, and a clever dip that often leaves goalkeepers scrambling. This isn't just about speculative efforts; he picks his moments intelligently, often arriving late on the edge of the box to unleash a thunderbolt that keeps opposition defences honest and adds a valuable source of goals. He’s the kind of player who can turn a stalemate into a lead with a single, spectacular strike from 25 yards out, elevating him from a mere creator to a true match-winner.

Of course, no player is without areas for development, and Ethan, while exceptional in so many facets, has specific attributes that are ripe for improvement within a top-tier environment. His aerial game, particularly **heading** in defensive situations, is an aspect where he doesn't dominate, often preferring to contest on the ground rather than in the air. Similarly, while his work rate in possession is phenomenal, his **stamina** can sometimes wane in the dying embers of a high-intensity match, suggesting that a tailored conditioning programme could elevate his performance across the full 90 minutes. In terms of defensive output, his **tackling** is more reliant on intelligent positioning and anticipation rather than a physically dominant challenge, meaning he can occasionally be bypassed in one-on-one defensive duels. However, these are precisely the kinds of attributes that can be significantly refined with dedicated coaching and tactical integration, especially within a system that plays to his strengths and provides intelligent cover. These minor considerations in no way detract from the monumental upside he offers, nor do they overshadow his breathtaking technical ability and tactical understanding.

At just 23 years old, Ethan Walker is entering the prime years of his career, with immense scope for further growth and refinement. He possesses the technical acumen, footballing brain, and sheer audacity to become a leading central midfielder for any top European club. His asking price of €45 million and a salary range of €70,000-€95,000 per week represent not just an acquisition, but an investment in a player who has all the tools to define a team's midfield for the next decade. This is more than just a transfer opportunity; it's a chance to secure a truly special talent, an English gem ready to shine brightest on the biggest stages. We must move decisively to secure his signature.
