    SCOUTING REPORT FOR Miloš Petrović
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Gentlemen, let me present a truly exceptional opportunity to bolster your defensive spine: Miloš Petrović. At 26, and coming from the demanding environment of Benfica, Miloš is not just a player; he’s a formidable presence, a leader, and a defender forged in the crucible of top-tier European football. He embodies the very essence of what it means to be a rock at the heart of the defence, a player who commands his area with an authority rarely seen in the modern game.

On the pitch, Miloš is a colossus in the air. His aerial ability isn't just a statistic; it's a spectacle. Whether he's clearing dangerous crosses from the heart of his own penalty box, rising above multiple opponents to win vital defensive headers, or attacking set-pieces with a ferocious determination that frequently leads to goal-scoring opportunities, he dominates the skies. Opposing strikers find themselves outmuscled and outjumped time and time again, nullifying a crucial dimension of their attack. Complementing this aerial prowess is his immaculate tackling. Miloš possesses that rare gift of being able to read the game, anticipate danger, and then execute a clean, decisive tackle that dispossesses an opponent without recourse to a foul. He steps in front, he slides in, he stands firm – time and again he wins the ball back, turning defence into attack in a blink. Crucially, his leadership shines through in every single match; he is constantly communicating, organising his backline, pointing, guiding, and instilling confidence in those around him. You can see him directing traffic, pushing his teammates, demanding the highest standards – he's a general on the field, a true captain-in-waiting who elevates the collective defensive effort.

Now, as with any player of substance, Miloš possesses areas for strategic consideration. His pace, while certainly not a debilitating flaw for a central defender, means he thrives best in a well-organised defensive unit where he isn't consistently exposed to open spaces against lightning-quick attackers. He excels when the defensive line is compact, allowing his positional intelligence and anticipation to shine, rather than relying solely on recovery speed. Similarly, his passing range is functional and safe, prioritising possession retention with short, accurate balls rather than consistently attempting to unlock defences with raking cross-field passes. This means he’s more of a stopper and a defensive anchor, rather than a ball-playing centre-back who dictates build-up from deep. Finally, his passion and commitment, while admirable, can sometimes manifest as a slight proneness to fouls, particularly when reacting to situations rather than anticipating them. This is an area that, with refined discipline and tactical understanding, can certainly be mitigated, ensuring his aggression remains an asset rather than a liability.

At 26, Miloš is entering the absolute prime of his career. He offers an immediate, tangible upgrade to any defensive unit, bringing not just elite defensive attributes but also invaluable experience from a major European club and the gravitas of a natural leader. He is the kind of player who organises the chaos, who brings a sense of calm and assuredness to the most pressured moments. While his price tag of €28 million reflects his quality and experience, his salary expectations are incredibly reasonable for a player of his calibre and proven track record. This is a chance to acquire a powerful, intelligent, and commanding centre-back who will lead by example for years to come. Miloš Petrović is more than just a signing; he is the foundation upon which you can build a formidable and resilient defensive future.
