    **Scouting Report: Marcel Dubois**

Marcel Dubois, the 34-year-old French striker currently plying his trade at LOSC Lille, presents an intriguing profile for clubs seeking immediate impact and seasoned leadership. Dubois is a right-footed centre-forward whose vast experience and footballing intelligence offer a compelling short-term solution for an ambitious side. His asking price of 5 million euro, with considerable negotiation space, reflects his age but also his continued value, while a salary range of 30,000-50,000 euro per week is a testament to his standing and the flexibility available.

At the heart of Dubois’s game is his **clinical finishing**. Despite his age, his eye for goal remains exceptionally sharp. In match situations, he consistently demonstrates an uncanny ability to convert chances, often with minimal backlift, making him a constant threat in and around the opposition box. His reliability with his preferred right foot ensures that when opportunities arise, whether from intricate build-up play or quick transitions, he is adept at turning half-chances into goals.

Beyond goal-scoring, Dubois is an accomplished practitioner of **link-up play**. He excels at dropping deep from the front or holding the ball up with excellent body strength, effectively acting as a pivot in the attacking third. In the build-up phase, he skillfully brings midfielders and wingers into play, allowing for intricate passing sequences and creating overloads in advanced areas. This facet of his game is crucial for teams that value possession and intricate attacking movements. Furthermore, Dubois is an **experienced leader**. His presence on the pitch is invaluable; he organises the attacking line, communicates tactical instructions, and motivates his teammates. He embodies a true winner's mentality, earned from a long and distinguished career that has seen him contribute significantly to his teams' successes and lift various honours. His calm demeanour and tactical acumen make him an ideal mentor for younger players within any squad.

However, any potential suitor must be mindful of Dubois's physical limitations, which are increasingly apparent with his age. His primary weakness is a noticeable **pace decline**. This means he is less effective in direct counter-attacks or chasing through-balls over long distances, often requiring deeper positioning during defensive transitions to conserve energy. He is no longer a player who will consistently beat defenders for speed, which limits his utility in systems heavily reliant on high-intensity pressing and quick, penetrative runs in behind.

This diminished athleticism also manifests in his **limited defensive work rate**. While his footballing intelligence allows him to position himself well to block passing lanes, Dubois primarily conserves his energy for attacking phases. This impacts a team's ability to implement a high-press from the front, necessitating tactical adjustments in the collective defensive structure, where other players must compensate for his less intense contributions in winning back possession. Finally, his **stamina over 90 minutes** is a concern. Towards the latter stages of matches, particularly past the 70-minute mark, Dubois's overall influence can wane, making full 90-minute high-intensity performances a challenge. This often leads to him being substituted or needing to carefully manage his exertions throughout the game, which can affect a team's ability to maintain offensive pressure for the entire duration.

In conclusion, Marcel Dubois from LOSC Lille remains a high-quality, experienced striker capable of delivering crucial goals and intelligent link-up play. He is an exceptional leader and mentor, bringing a winning mentality to the locker room. His physical limitations, particularly his pace, defensive work rate, and stamina, mean he thrives best in a system that can accommodate these aspects, perhaps as a focal point in a possession-based side or as a high-impact player for specific periods of a match. His availability at a negotiable 5 million euro asking price and a flexible salary range offers a strategic opportunity for a club seeking immediate quality and invaluable experience.
