    SCOUTING REPORT FOR Michael Davis
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Gentlemen, I'm here to talk about a talent that truly sets pulses racing – Michael Davis. At 25, this Portuguese maestro from Porto United isn't just an attacking midfielder; he's the very heartbeat of creativity, a player whose right foot possesses a rare blend of surgical precision and explosive power. He embodies the modern "number 10" in every glorious sense, a player capable of unlocking the most stubborn defenses with a single, audacious flick of his boot.

What truly distinguishes Michael on the pitch is his extraordinary **vision**. He doesn't just see passes; he foresees the unfolding play two or three moves ahead, painting pictures that only a select few can perceive. This isn't theoretical; it manifests in breathtaking fashion. Imagine a crowded midfield, seemingly impenetrable, and suddenly, Michael delivers a through-ball, weighted to perfection, that dissects lines and leaves a striker one-on-one with the keeper. His **passing** range is simply phenomenal – from incisive, defence-splitting ground passes to sweeping, diagonal balls that switch the play with laser-like accuracy, every pass is imbued with intent and intelligence. He's the architect, the puppet master, dictating the tempo and direction of every attacking surge, turning half-chances into golden opportunities.

But Michael is far more than just a provider; he's a genuine goal threat in his own right, particularly from distance. His **long shots** are a weapon that many defenders dread. With either time and space or even under pressure, he possesses the uncanny ability to unleash fierce, dipping, or curling efforts that consistently find the top corner. He doesn't just shoot; he aims with conviction, often catching goalkeepers completely off guard. This makes him incredibly difficult to mark, as defenders cannot afford to give him even a yard of space within 30 yards of goal. He's a player who can decide a tight game with a moment of individual brilliance, a true match-winner who demands attention.

Now, as with any truly artistic player, there are elements where Michael's game needs consideration. His **defensive contribution**, while not negligible, isn't his natural inclination. He conserves his energy for what he does best – creating and attacking. This means a tactical setup would need to accommodate his strengths, perhaps with a robust midfield alongside him to cover ground and ensure balance. Similarly, his **physicality** is not his strong suit. He's not one to dominate aerial duels or muscle opponents off the ball in a protracted midfield grind. While he's deceptively agile and excellent at protecting the ball with his body, he thrives in space and with the ball at his feet, rather than in physical battles. His **aerial ability** is consequently an area where he offers very little, meaning set-piece routines would rarely involve him as a primary target in the box.

However, these aspects are tactical considerations, not deal-breakers, especially when weighed against his immense creative output. At 25, Michael is entering the absolute prime of his career. He has the experience of playing at a top club like Porto United, performing consistently at a high level. His potential to elevate a team's attacking prowess is immense. For a club with aspirations of challenging for major honours, a team that values incisive attacking play and wants a genuine game-changer in the final third, Michael Davis represents an investment in pure, unadulterated creativity. He will be the player who dictates games, who creates the magic, and who delivers those match-winning moments. Imagine him, orchestrating play, pulling the strings, and unleashing thunderbolts from outside the box – that's the impact he guarantees.

His asking price of €45 million and a salary range of €70,000-€100,000 a week are a reflection of his proven quality and burgeoning influence. He's not a prospect; he's a ready-made star, poised to take the next monumental step. Michael Davis isn't just a signing; he's a statement, a player who will ignite the imagination of fans and opponents alike. He is, simply put, a special talent.
