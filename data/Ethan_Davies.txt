    SCOUTING REPORT FOR Ethan Davies
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    Subject: Urgent Scout Report – Ethan Davies (Everton FC)

To the Board,

I write to you today with a fervent recommendation regarding a player who I believe could be the linchpin of our defensive future: Ethan Davies. At 26 years old, the English centre-back from Everton is not merely a player; he is a force of nature in the defensive third, possessing an old-school grit combined with modern tactical intelligence that truly sets him apart.

Davies is, first and foremost, a quintessential defender. His playstyle is built around absolute dominance and unyielding resistance. When you watch him, his *aerial prowess* is immediately apparent and genuinely breathtaking. He commands his box like a hawk surveying its territory, rising above opponents with an almost arrogant ease to clear crosses, win goal kicks, and even threaten offensively from set-pieces. This isn't just about height; it's about timing, power, and an insatiable desire to win the first ball. He consistently alleviates pressure by claiming these aerial duels, turning potential danger into routine clearance. Complementing this, his *tackling* is nothing short of exceptional. Davies reads the game like an open book, anticipating runs and positioning himself to execute perfectly timed, clean challenges. He doesn't dive in; he waits, pounces, and dispossesses with a satisfying thud, often turning defence into quick transition. This ability to decisively win the ball often stifles opposition attacks before they truly begin to build momentum in dangerous areas. Beyond individual actions, his *leadership* shines through in every match. He's a vocal organiser, constantly pointing, communicating, and marshaling his backline, ensuring everyone is in sync. He sets an example through his tireless work rate and commitment, demanding the same level of intensity from those around him. You can see the respect he commands from his teammates; he is the defensive general, the one who steadies the ship when the waves get rough.

However, in full transparency, it is vital to acknowledge the areas where Davies can be challenged, and crucially, how we can mitigate these. His primary weakness is his *pace*. Against lightning-quick forwards making darting runs in behind, or when asked to cover large expanses of space, particularly out wide, he can be exposed. This means a tactical system that provides cover, perhaps with athletic full-backs or a holding midfielder who drops deep, would maximise his immense strengths while cushioning this particular vulnerability. Similarly, his *passing range* is not his strongest suit. While he is reliable with short, safe passes, he’s less inclined to spray pinpoint diagonal balls or break lines with ambitious through passes from deep. This limits his contribution to direct build-up play from the back, requiring creative impetus to come from midfield or wider areas. Finally, his *discipline* can sometimes be a concern. His intense desire to win the ball and his robust style can sometimes lead to unnecessary fouls in dangerous areas or, on occasion, a booking that could have been avoided. This is often a byproduct of his passion and competitive spirit, something that can be refined with experience and targeted coaching rather than stifled.

Despite these areas for improvement, I firmly believe Ethan Davies represents an extraordinary opportunity. At 26, he is entering his absolute prime, with years of top-level performance ahead of him. His immense strengths in aerial duels, tackling, and leadership are not just desirable; they are foundational qualities that elevate any defence. Imagine him anchoring our backline, dominating set pieces, and marshaling our troops. His weaknesses are manageable within a well-structured team and can be further improved under our coaching staff. He offers immediate impact and significant long-term value, bringing a winning mentality and an uncompromising defensive steel that could truly transform our defensive solidity.

This is a player worth every penny of his €45 million asking price, which I believe we have scope to negotiate, particularly given his reasonable salary expectations. He is the missing piece, the defensive rock, we need. I urge you to pursue Ethan Davies with the utmost urgency and conviction.
