    **Scouting Report: Mikael Johansson**

Mikael Johansson, a highly experienced 35-year-old Swedish goalkeeper currently with Malmö FF, presents an interesting profile for clubs seeking a seasoned veteran between the posts. Operating predominantly as a right-footed keeper, Johansson brings a wealth of experience and a calm presence to the backline.

Johansson’s primary strengths lie in his exceptional leadership qualities and consistent shot-stopping ability. He is a commanding figure in the penalty area, constantly organizing his defence and communicating effectively, which is vital in maintaining structure during opponent build-up and preventing dangerous transitions. His leadership extends beyond just vocal commands; he possesses a strong winner mentality, driving his teammates and setting high standards. On the line, his shot-stopping remains a key asset, demonstrating reliability in preventing clear goal-scoring opportunities. Furthermore, his distribution, particularly with his preferred right foot, is excellent; he can initiate quick counter-attacks or calmly recycle possession during build-up phases, an attribute that is increasingly valued in modern football.

However, at 35, there are noticeable declines in certain physical aspects of his game. His reflexes have predictably started to diminish, making him more vulnerable to powerful, close-range efforts or deflections that require split-second reactions. Similarly, his pace off the line has waned, which can be exploited by opponents playing through balls over the defence, requiring his backline to drop deeper or become more exposed during transitions if the opponent bypasses the press. Aerial command in crowded boxes also presents a weakness; while he attempts to assert dominance, he can struggle in very congested situations, such as corners or free-kicks, leading to uncertainty and potential for opponents to capitalize on second balls.

Despite these physical limitations, Johansson's profound experience and leadership are undeniable. He has undoubtedly earned significant honours throughout his career, contributing to domestic triumphs with Malmö FF and demonstrating the winning mentality required at the highest level. From a market perspective, Malmö FF is asking for a reasonable 1.5 million euro, with considerable room for negotiation. His salary requirements, ranging from 15,000-20,000 euro per week, also show some flexibility, making him an economically viable option for a club looking for an immediate impact player rather than a long-term investment. Johansson represents a valuable addition for a team needing an authoritative presence, reliable hands, and excellent distribution, provided defensive tactics can mitigate his physical declines.
