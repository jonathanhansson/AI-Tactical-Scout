    SCOUTING REPORT FOR Robert Wilson
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    To the esteemed leadership and scouting department,

I am delighted to present an unparalleled opportunity for our club: the acquisition of Robert Wilson, a striker currently plying his trade at Manchester United. At 24 years of age, Wilson is not merely a promising talent; he is a proven, battle-hardened goal-scorer standing on the precipice of his absolute prime, ready to elevate any top-tier attacking line. His profile screams elite performance, and I firmly believe he represents a critical investment for our future ambitions.

On the pitch, Robert Wilson embodies the quintessential modern striker, a predatory presence whose every movement is geared towards finding the back of the net. His playstyle is characterized by an almost unnerving efficiency in front of goal; his **clinical finishing** is truly a sight to behold. It’s not just about power, but precision, composure, and a remarkable ability to find the smallest gaps. Whether it's a first-time strike from inside the box, a calm one-on-one finish, or a deft touch to guide the ball past a sprawling goalkeeper, Wilson consistently converts chances that many others would squander. This reliability in crucial moments is what sets him apart, turning half-chances into genuine threats and often the difference between a draw and a victory.

Beyond his finishing prowess, Wilson's game is underpinned by electrifying **pace** and intelligent **off-ball movement**. He is a constant menace to opposition defences, perpetually looking to exploit the channels and run in behind. His acceleration allows him to surge away from markers, creating vital separation that opens up space not just for himself, but for his teammates too. This pace, combined with his exceptional understanding of defensive lines, means he’s incredibly adept at timing his runs to perfection, arriving in dangerous areas at the precise moment to latch onto through-balls. He drifts between defenders, pops up in unexpected pockets of space, and creates confusion, fundamentally disrupting the opposition’s defensive structure. He's not merely a recipient of chances; he actively manufactures them through his relentless and astute movement.

Naturally, like any player, Robert possesses areas for development, but it is crucial to understand these in the context of his specialist role. His **aerial ability** is not a dominant feature of his game; he's not the target man who will consistently win towering headers against imposing centre-backs. However, he intelligently compensates by staying on the ground, focusing on his quickness and movement to exploit gaps rather than engaging in physical battles in the air. Similarly, his **defensive contribution** is not extensive. While he's willing to engage in the occasional press, he conserves his energy for his primary responsibility: attacking and scoring goals. He is a striker whose focus is singularly on creating and converting opportunities, and his energy output is channeled overwhelmingly into that objective. Finally, his **passing range** tends to be more functional than expansive. He prioritises direct, incisive play in the final third rather than dictating play from deep, but this is a characteristic, not a flaw, of a player whose primary instinct is to drive towards goal.

Considering his age, current performances at Manchester United, and his core strengths, Robert Wilson’s future potential is immense. He is entering the peak years for a striker, where physical prowess, tactical understanding, and mental maturity converge. He has already proven his mettle at the very highest level of English football, consistently delivering against top-tier opposition. With focused coaching and a system built to maximise his attributes, he has the capacity to evolve into a truly world-class number nine, a prolific goalscorer who can lead the line for any club with aspirations of silverware. His English nationality further enhances his value, offering not just quality on the pitch but also domestic marketability and squad registration advantages.

While the asking price of 65 million euro is substantial, it reflects the market value for a proven, in-form, English striker from a top club, heading into his prime. This is not merely a transfer; it is an investment in guaranteed goals, decisive moments, and a player who can genuinely transform our attacking output for years to come. I urge our swift consideration of Robert Wilson; he is the difference-maker we are seeking.
