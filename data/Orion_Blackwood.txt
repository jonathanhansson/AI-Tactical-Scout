    SCOUTING REPORT FOR Orion Blackwood
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    **Scouting Report: Orion Blackwood**

**Player Profile:**
Orion Blackwood, a 34-year-old Scottish center-back, currently plies his trade at Celtic FC. A right-footed defender, Blackwood embodies the classic experienced stopper, bringing a wealth of knowledge and presence to the backline.

**Strengths:**
Blackwood's primary attributes revolve around his exceptional **leadership**. On the pitch, he is a clear vocal commander, constantly organizing his defense, dictating positions, and marshalling younger teammates. This leadership extends beyond communication; he sets a demanding standard through his consistent performances and professional conduct, which is a hallmark of his long and distinguished career with Celtic FC. His **aerial prowess** is another significant asset. Blackwood consistently dominates in the air, effectively clearing danger from defensive set-pieces and open play, while also posing a considerable threat in the opposition box, often getting on the end of crosses and corners. His **tactical awareness** is arguably his most valuable trait, particularly at this stage of his career. He possesses an innate ability to read the game, anticipate opposition movements, and position himself optimally to intercept passes or block shots. This allows him to negate threats before they fully materialize, ensuring defensive solidity. In the build-up phase, his tactical understanding translates into intelligent decision-making, knowing when to distribute simply and when to attempt more progressive passes, always prioritizing possession and control.

**Mentality and Achievements:**
Having spent a significant portion of his career at a club of Celtic's stature, Blackwood possesses a genuine winner's mentality. He understands the demands of competing for titles and the pressure of high-stakes matches. This experience is reflected in his calm demeanor under pressure and his ability to rally those around him. While specific details are outside the scope of this report, it is highly probable that he has accumulated a significant number of domestic honours throughout his time with Celtic, contributing to his proven track record of success.

**Weaknesses:**
The natural progression of age has, as expected, impacted some of Blackwood's physical attributes. His **pace** and **agility** are noticeable weaknesses, particularly when facing quick, dynamic forwards or being pulled into wide channels. This often manifests in transitions, where he struggles to keep up with rapid counter-attacks, making him vulnerable if his team is caught high up the pitch. Similarly, his **recovery speed** is limited, meaning if he is beaten for pace or drawn out of position, he finds it challenging to recover and regain his defensive shape or track a runner effectively. Teams employing a high defensive line or an aggressive pressing system might find these limitations exposed, requiring careful tactical consideration to provide adequate cover for him.

**Market Assessment:**
Orion Blackwood represents a highly experienced and respected center-back whose value lies in his mental and technical attributes rather than his fading physical ones. At an asking price of 5 million euros, with some negotiation space available, and a salary range of 40,000-60,000 euros per week (also with negotiation flexibility), he would be an acquisition primarily for a team seeking immediate leadership, defensive organization, and aerial dominance. His profile suggests he could thrive in a team that plays with a deeper defensive line or where his physical limitations can be mitigated by athletic partners or a robust midfield screen. He is not a long-term investment, but a valuable short-to-medium term solution for a club looking for a seasoned professional to anchor their defense and instill a winning mentality.
