    SCOUTING REPORT FOR Kenneth Hernandez
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    To the esteemed leadership, I present a truly exhilarating prospect, a talent poised to explode onto the European stage: Kenneth Hernandez. At just 20 years old, this attacking midfielder for SSC Napoli is an Italian marvel with a left foot that whispers poetry and delivers thunder. He represents that rare breed of player who combines raw, innate talent with a surprisingly mature footballing brain, making his current asking price of 25 million euro and salary range of 68000-87000 euro/week a sound investment for any club with ambitions.

On the pitch, Kenneth operates as a vibrant, dynamic force in the final third. His playstyle is characterized by an almost audacious confidence, always looking to receive the ball in tight spaces and drive forward. His dribbling is truly exceptional; he possesses a mesmerizing ability to slither past defenders, manipulating the ball with razor-sharp close control and a low center of gravity, often leaving opponents flailing in his wake as he carves open defensive lines. What truly sets him apart, however, is a leadership quality that belies his tender age. He’s not merely a passenger; he actively demands the ball, directs play with sharp, decisive passes, and visibly encourages his teammates, taking responsibility when the game is on the line. Furthermore, for an attacking midfielder, his capacity for interceptions is remarkable. He isn't content to simply wait for the ball; he actively presses high, reading passing lanes with uncanny anticipation and winning possession in dangerous areas, often sparking rapid counter-attacks with his immediate forward thrust. This blend of creative flair and defensive diligence makes him a truly modern number ten, capable of influencing the game at both ends of the pitch.

However, like any unpolished gem, Kenneth comes with areas ripe for development. His fiery passion, while contributing to his leadership, sometimes manifests as a lack of discipline, leading to unnecessary bookings or fouls in critical moments. This is something that needs careful coaching to channel that intensity productively. Additionally, his offside awareness can occasionally be found wanting; he sometimes makes his runs a fraction too early, limiting his ability to exploit spaces behind the defensive line or receive perfectly weighted through balls. While his ground game is sublime, his aerial duels are an obvious weakness. Given his frame and playstyle, this is perhaps less of a concern, but it does mean he’s unlikely to be a target man or win many flick-ons in central areas, requiring his team to play to his strengths on the deck.

Despite these minor imperfections, Kenneth Hernandez's future potential is nothing short of stratospheric. At 20, he already exhibits a skill set that many professionals strive for their entire careers. With focused coaching on his temperament and positional awareness, particularly regarding the offside trap, he has the capacity to evolve into an elite attacking midfielder, a difference-maker who can consistently create chances, score goals, and dictate the tempo of attacking play at the very highest level. The leadership qualities he displays at such a young age suggest he has the mental fortitude to overcome challenges and adapt to new environments. Securing Kenneth now is not just acquiring a promising talent; it's investing in a player who, in the coming years, has all the hallmarks of becoming a cornerstone of a successful team, a true star who will define an era. He is ready to take the next monumental step in his burgeoning career.
